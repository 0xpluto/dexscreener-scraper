# DexScreener Scraper

This project was created using selenium and a headless FireFox browser in an anaconda environment

## Currently Available Chains

The other chains available to dexscreener can probably be added
with no extra changes but these were the ones that I needed. If any new ones would be added then the constants is all that needs to change.

1. Ethereum (Chain ID: 1)
2. Optimism (Chain ID: 10)
3. Binance Smart Chain (Chain ID: 56)
4. Gnosis (Chain ID: 100)
5. Polygon (Chain ID: 137)
6. Fantom (Chain ID: 250)
7. Arbitrum (Chain ID: 42161)
8. Avalanche (Chain ID: 43114)

## Organization

DexScreener allows you to sort the tokens by certain values.
The top coins for which ever value chosen will be the ones outputted to the file.
